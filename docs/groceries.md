## 2022 Telluride Grocery List

There are 11 of us this year -- Plan accordingly.  Please edit the list below, and color your edits in red, so that we can see that you made a change.  It's important for you to indicate the quantity you need, too.

We now have a full complement of cooks and meals.  I suggest this order because Chris is arriving Monday, Pickle leaves Friday, Mike leaves Saturday, and to avoid having tomato flavored sauces two nights in a row.  However, we can change the nights no problem:

- Sunday night dining out.
- Pickle - Enchiladas & Salad
- Lance - Pulled Pork & Salad
- Tim/Teo - Pasta & Salad
- Mike - Baked Fish
- Chris - Lasagna & Salad
- Saturday night leftovers


### Teo will shop for these:
Chicken Enchiladas (Pickle will make) - Tim added from what Pickle emailed:
2.5-3 lbs chicken breasts
1 large onion
3 orange or red peppers
24 oz Mexican cheese mix
36 CORN tortillas (NOT flour) 
2 cans of black beans
small sour cream
fresh cilantro (to use with enchiladas and in Steve's guacamole)
deleted salsa because 2 jars included below under snacks
(Pickle will bring the enchilada sauce)

Pickle wrote: I’d accompany a salad with the enchiladas - Tim increased salad amounts from 2 to 3 nights in salad below based on this sentence.

Mike wrote: Jack Daniels
Tim writes: Do we really want 4 different kinds/bottles of liquor?

### Tim and Teo will shop for the wine:
Red wine - 6 bottles (at $10-$15 per bottle) for the week and then we can get more in Telluride depending on how the beer vs wine consumption works out.
1 bottle Chardonnay

### Joe and Mike will shop for the beer:
Beer: 
Joe and Mike will be in charge of selecting beer, since they are in the first van.  
Pls get two six packs of session IPA for Hud and I. (<-- Tim thinks that Chris wrote this line, so that means we are covered for Hud and Chris).

Steve wrote: On the beer list, something not as high alcohol as the typical IPA (but also not the coors light).  Example: Pale ale, session IPA, Hazy IPA...those are usually 6.5% or less. Sometimes IPAs are 7.5% and higher.  I also expect that Dad (and maybe Mike) would drink coors light or something like that.

Mike wrote: Yuengling ( black or gold if available ) or Dos Equis ( amber if available ) or other beers
Joe says: a light craft beer, or a light mass brand beer, but not an IPA.
